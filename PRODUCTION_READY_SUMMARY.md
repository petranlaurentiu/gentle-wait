## 📋 Next Steps (Required)

### Step 1: Add Swift Files to Xcode (5 minutes)

**Why**: Xcode needs to compile Swift files, but they must be manually added to the project.

**How**:
```bash
# Option A: Use helper script
npm run setup-ios

# Option B: Manual
open ios/gentlewait.xcworkspace
```

In Xcode:
1. Right-click `gentlewait` folder → "Add Files to 'gentlewait'..."
2. Select both:
   - `ios/gentlewait/GentleWaitModule.swift`
   - `ios/gentlewait/GentleWaitModule.m`
3. ✅ Check "Copy items if needed"
4. ✅ Check "Add to targets: gentlewait"
5. Click "Add"
6. Build: **⌘B** (Command + B)

**Expected**: Build succeeds with 0 errors.

---

### Step 2: Test iOS Build (10 minutes)

```bash
npm run ios
```

**Test**:
1. ✅ App launches on simulator
2. ✅ Onboarding flow works
3. ✅ Family Controls permission prompt appears
4. ✅ Can authorize Family Controls
5. ✅ Settings persist
6. ✅ Alternatives screen works

**If issues**: See troubleshooting in `PRODUCTION_BUILD_GUIDE.md`

---

### Step 3: Test Android Build (10 minutes)

```bash
npm run android
```

**Test**:
1. ✅ App launches on emulator/device
2. ✅ Onboarding flow works
3. ✅ Accessibility Service prompt appears
4. ✅ Can enable Accessibility Service
5. ✅ App interception works
6. ✅ All alternatives work

**If issues**: See `QUICK_START_ANDROID.md`

---

### Step 4: Create Preview Builds (20 minutes)

**Why**: Test the exact builds that will go to stores.

```bash
# Install EAS CLI (if not already)
npm install -g eas-cli

# Login to Expo
eas login

# Build preview for iOS
npm run build:preview:ios

# Build preview for Android  
npm run build:preview:android
```

**Expected**: Builds complete on EAS servers (~10-15 min each)

**Test**: Download and install on physical devices, run full test suite.

---

### Step 5: Prepare Store Assets (1-2 hours)

Use `PRE_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md` as your guide.

#### Required Assets:

**App Icon**:
- 1024x1024 PNG (no transparency)
- Follows platform guidelines

**Screenshots** (minimum):
- iOS: 5 screenshots (6.5" iPhone)
- Android: 2 screenshots (1080x1920)

**Descriptions**:
- App name (30 chars max)
- Short description (80 chars) - Android

- Full description (4000 chars max)
- Keywords (100 chars) - iOS

**Legal**:
- Privacy Policy URL (required)

- Terms of Service (optional but recommended)

**Template**: See `PRODUCTION_BUILD_GUIDE.md` for description template.

### Step 6: Production Builds (30 minutes)

When ready to submit:

```bash
# Build for production (both platforms)
npm run build:prod:all
```

**Expected**: 
- iOS: `.ipa` file ready for App Store Connect
- Android: `.aab` file ready for Play Console

---

### Step 7: Submit to Stores (1-2 hours)

#### iOS (App Store Connect)

```bash
eas submit --platform ios
```

Or manually:
1. Upload IPA to App Store Connect
2. Fill in app information
3. Add screenshots
4. **Important**: In "App Review Information", explain Family Controls usage in detail
5. Submit for review

**Review time**: 2-3 weeks (first submission due to Family Controls)

#### Android (Play Console)

```bash
eas submit --platform android
```

Or manually:
1. Upload AAB to Play Console
2. Create production release
3. Fill in store listing
